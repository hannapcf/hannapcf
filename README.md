- 📚 Currently, I'm pursuing an MBA in Software Engineering at USP (São Paulo, Brazil 🇧🇷).
- 🍎 Proud alumna of the Apple Developer Academy, class of 2022.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a Lawyer! However, my true passion lies in technology, programming, and design. Hence, in 2020, I embarked on a career transition to follow my dreams!
- 💡 My ultimate goal? To establish a tech company where I can drive positive social impact for minorities in Brazil!
